 horsthelp.2.d: "The Horst Tool system is designed to make hosting games more convenient and prevent time wasted on hotjoining players mid-game, as well as ensuring games don't end prematurely due to Germany researching incorrect bonuses, etc. The Horst Tool has several features: \n\n 1. Changing Borders \nThe horsttool can annex countries, transfer regions, and grant national territories. To annex a country, first select one of its regions, then click 'Mark Region', and finally click the 'Annex' button. Transferring regions and granting national territories follow the same principle. \n\n2. Adding Technology Bonuses. \nIf you need to grant a technology bonus to a country, first click on it, then find the table labeled 'Cheats' and choose the appropriate bonus. \n\n3. Sending Players to Observers. \nTo do this, simply click on the desired country and then on the large binocular icon. \n\n4. Signing Peace. \nTo sign peace for a country with all others, click on the desired country and then on the 'Armistice' button."
