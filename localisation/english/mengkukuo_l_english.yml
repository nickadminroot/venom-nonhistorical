 mengkukuo.6.t: "The Mongolians win"

 mengkukuo.11.t: "Unopposed march into Ningxia"

 mengkukuo.14.t: "[MEN.GetNameDefCap] proposes unification"
 mengkukuo.14.d: "[MEN.GetLeader] got the wise idea that our two nations shouldnt be divided. Of course this is not an abstract idea, most Mongolians want this. Recent tensions between our once ideological different nations have prevented this however. Now has the time finally come to decide."
 mengkukuo.14.a: "Lets unite with our brothers"
 mengkukuo.14.b: "They dont deserve us"
 mengkukuo.15.t: "[MON.GetNameDefCap] accepts our proposal"
 mengkukuo.15.d: "The wise [MON.GetLeader] has agreed to unite our two nations. Now the question arises which government should absorb the other one? It is silly to believe that our governments function exactly the same, so it becomes apparent that one government needs to be disbanded."
