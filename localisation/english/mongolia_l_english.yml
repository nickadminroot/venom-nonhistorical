 mongolia.41.t: "Coalition with the NTS?"
 mongolia.41.d: "Some parts of the white movement perceive us as weak, so it may prove useful to go into a coalition with the NTS, or else some of the more aggressive parts of the whites may split off from the NTS.

 mongolia.49.t: "The Soviets accept our deal"
