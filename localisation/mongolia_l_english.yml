 mongolia.28.t:0 "The Qinghai Question"
 mongolia.28.d:0 "Now that the Region of Qinghai is under our control we have to ask the question if the people living there belong to our Nation. The Region has a sizable amount of Mongolians living in it, but there are also many Tibetans. The Question arises, should we promote Mongolian Education in this State to make the remaining non-Mongolian Population accepting of our rule, or should we give it to the Tibetans, who will perhaps support our Nation more through this act of Friendship?"
 mongolia.28.a:0 "They are Mongolians!"
 mongolia.28.b:0 "Tibet is the right choice"
 mongolia.29.t:0 "Qinghai Annexation"
 mongolia.29.d:0 "The Mongolian Government has offered our Nation the State of Qinghai, which houses a large Tibetan Population. Tibetan Nationalists take pride in this act, but critcs argue that Mongolia probably wants to gain something through this act."
 mongolia.29.a:0 "Lets celebrate!"
 mongolia.30.t:0 "Tibet and Xikang"
 mongolia.30.d:0 "There is no doubt that Tibet has a rightful claim over Xikang. The Population sees itself as Tibetan, and historically Tibet had a presence in the Region.

 mongolia.30.b:0 "What have the Tibetans ever done for us?"
 mongolia.31.t:0 "Xikang is finally ours!"

 mongolia.32.b:0 "It may prove difficult"
 mongolia.33.t:0 "The Integration of Dzungaria"
 mongolia.33.d:0 "The Dzungar Culture has been promoted more in northern Xinjiang, which helped form a national identity that is loyal to our Nation. Uyghurs have also started to see the benefit of our Nation in contrast to the previous owners of the region because of increased funding into the region."
 mongolia.33.a:0 "Dzungars, Uyghurs and Mongolians, together, peacefully."
 mongolia.34.t:0 "Integration of Dzungaria"

 mongolia.35.d:0 "The Mongolian Government has managed to revive the Dzungar Culture in northern Xinjiang. This Culture has been declining for some time now, but through efforts by the government Mongolia was able to achieve integration in the region. Now Mongolia demands that we give them these states."
 mongolia.35.a:0 "Alright"
 mongolia.35.b:0 "Xinjiang wont submit"
 mongolia.36.t:0 "The Integration of Dzungaria"
 mongolia.36.d:0 "The Dzungar Culture has been promoted more in northern Xinjiang, which helped form a national identity that is loyal to our Nation. Uyghurs have also started to see the benefit of our Nation in contrast to the previous owners of the region because of increased funding into the region."
 mongolia.36.a:0 "Dzungars, Uyghurs and Mongolians, together, peacefully."
 mongolia.37.t:0 "Xinjiang refuses to hand over Mongolian Core territories"
 mongolia.37.d:0 "The local government in Xinjiang has refused to give us the territories that we were able to integrate into our nation. The people in these states long to be part of greater Mongolia, but now they wont be able to."

 mongolia.38.t:0 "Integration of the Kalmyks"

 mongolia.39.t:0 "The National Alliance of Russian Solidarists forms"
 mongolia.39.d:0 "The National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, or in russian Nacional'no Trudovoj Sojuz, has begun political activity in mongolia.

 mongolia.40.t:0 "The NTS assists our war effort"
 mongolia.40.d:0 "To support our war against the communists the NTS has offered us equipment that has been stolen from various factories in the Soviet Union."
 mongolia.40.a:0 "We will win this War!"
 mongolia.41.t:0 "Coalition with the NTS?"
 mongolia.41.d:0 "Some parts of the white movement perceive us as weak, so it may prove useful to go into a coalition with the NTS, or else some of the more aggressive parts of the whites may split off from the NTS. The NTS would probably agree to this offer, though going into a coalition could make decision making harder as the NTS would gain more Veto power."
 mongolia.41.a:0 "A Coalition always proves useful"
 mongolia.41.b:0 "Arent we all fighting for the same cause?"
 mongolia.42.t:0 "The Far-Right goes into opposition"
 mongolia.42.d:0 "Even though we are fighting for the same cause various parts of the white movement have different visions of the russia that should exist when the Soviet Union falls. One of the Far-Right parts of the white movements has now revived the Soyuz Russkogo Naroda, a former white party that was similar to nazism, though it supported the tsar. If the party finds a suitable leader they may try to gain power, neither peaceful nor democratic"

 mongolia.43.t:0 "The Coup of the SRN"
 mongolia.43.d:0 "The day has come. The SRN has found a suitable leader for their party and has proceeded to coup the democratically elected government. Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov, the new head of the party and government, has proclaimed his vision for a strong russia. The world stares in disbelief as yet another chance for the russian people to live in a democratic government has vanished."

 mongolia.48.t:0 "Mongolia wants to supply our War Effort"
 mongolia.48.d:0 "The Mongolian Government offers us supplies to support our war, however they would expect some compensation for this. The various goods, especially warm clothes, could significantly reduce the deaths of our soldiers through attrition."
 mongolia.48.a:0 "Great deal"
 mongolia.48.b:0 "We cant afford this at the moment"
 mongolia.49.t:0 "The Soviets accept our deal"
 mongolia.49.d:0 "Due to the acceptance from the Soviets regarding our deal we will be able to get some payment from them. This will surely be great for the economy!"
 mongolia.49.a:0 "Just making easy money"
 mongolia.50.t:0 "The Soviets decline our deal"

 mongolia.52.b:0 "These territories have always been chinese."
 mongolia.53.t:0 "The Mengjiang Agreement - [From.GetNameDefCap] accepts our proposal"
 mongolia.53.d:0 "In the Mengjiang Conference we were able to succesfully propose our ideas for a mongolian annexation of Mengkukuo. [From.GetLeader] is a wise man for recognizing our legitimate claim and giving up his claims on the region peacefully."
 mongolia.53.a:0 "Mengjiang is Mongolian"
 mongolia.54.t:0 "The Mengjiang Disagreement - [From.GetNameDefCap] doesnt accept our proposal"
 mongolia.54.d:0 "This is madness. How could [From.GetLeader] fail to realize that this region has always been mongolian and will continue to be so? The Mengjiang Conference has been widely regarded as a utter failure."
 mongolia.54.a:0 "Wasted Effort"
 mongolia.54.b:0 "This is unacceptable"
 mongolia.55.t:0 "The Visit of Henry Wallace"
 mongolia.55.d:0 "Henry Wallace, Vice President of the United States, has visited Mongolia to look into the status of Mongolian Autonomy. While our Nation has been independent for a while now, the Chinese government continues to claim the Outer Mongolia region as their own territory. Due to the war with Japan it has become an important matter to the United States to determine how Asia should look after the War. While the Chinese Government would want Mongolia to be their own Henry Wallace has instead visited Mongolia and determined that our sovereignity needs to be preserved."
 mongolia.55.a:0 "We have showed us from our best side"
 mongolia.56.t:0 "Join Mongolia?"
 mongolia.56.d:0 "The People of Tannu Tuva consider themselves mongolian, and if it werent for the Soviet Union we would be one nation. Maybe it is a good decision to join the mongolian nation. While [TAN.GetLeader] opposes the idea of losing power, [MON.GetLeader] has made it clear time and time again that the Tuvan government would still hold some local power."
 mongolia.56.a:0 "Good Idea"

 mongolia.58.t:0 "[MON.GetLeader] proposes a Non-Aggression Pact"
 mongolia.58.d:0 "The new white russian state in the country that was once known as mongolia proposes a friendship treaty. It is very likely that they will soon go to war with the Soviet Union, so it is a logical decision to accept the treaty. It could give us a ally in the unlikely case of their victory."
 mongolia.58.a:0 "Of course. They are the legitimate Russian government!"
 mongolia.58.b:0 "They wont get anything done"
 mongolia.59.t:0 "Japan accepts the Non-Aggression Pact"
 mongolia.59.d:0 "The japanese are wise people. They accept our proposal. This friendship treaty doesnt just guarentee peace between our countries, but also makes it clear that Japan sees us as the legitimate government of Russia!"
 mongolia.59.a:0 "Their friendship will be useful"

 mongolia.61.b:0 "Moscow!"
 mongolia.62.t:0 "The Monarchy Question"
 mongolia.62.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has supported a return to the monarchy for a long time now. Since Russia is once again united under a regime that is friendly to monarchist ideas it might be a good idea to restore the Tsardom."
 mongolia.62.a:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
 mongolia.62.b:0 "The Tsar will only be constitutional"
 mongolia.62.c:0 "The Monarchy wont return"
 mongolia.63.t:0 "The Russian Question"
